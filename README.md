# Brain Tumour Classification (Computer Vision Medical Imaging)

### Project Description
Classifying labeled 2D brain MRI scans as having a tumour or not through the use of a CNN (Supervised Learning). While working on this project, it was decided that due to insufficient local compute resources, the remainder of training would be completed in Google Colab to make use of its GPU runtime - therefore, the most up-to-date code for the final model are in the Google Drive folder linked below. Furthermore, the report (also linked below) discusses background, methodologies, and results in detail. 

### Quantitative Results

| Network         | Train Acc                                                    | Val Acc                                                      | Test Acc                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------|
| Model A         | 92.5% | 90.4% | 68.3% |
| Model B         | 84.2% | 85% | 73.7% | 
| Selected Model  | 90.1% | 87.5% | 88.3% |
